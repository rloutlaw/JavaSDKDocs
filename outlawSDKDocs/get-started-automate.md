# Get started with Java in Azure

## Automate deployment from GitHub

Automate deployment of your application whenever a hosted repo is updated. The previous steps showed manually pushing from a local Git repo to a Azure Git repo, but you can also have Azure deploy your changes when you push to repos hosted in GitHub, Visual Studio Team Services, or BitBucket.

## Configure your fork for continuous delivery

## Deploy from Jenkins

(Jenkins invokes `mvn deploy` which pushes artifacts via FTP to App Service)
