# Java for Azure Developers

Azure makes it easy to develop, deploy, and manage Java apps. Java developers on Azure can:

- Create apps using your favorite tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, Maven and Gradle.
- Integrate services like [SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server) and [Azure storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-introduction) into new or existing applications.
- Build, deploy, scale, and monitor your applications.
- Automate configuration of Azure resources from your Java code.

New to Azure? Get your [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and get started building your first application in [Eclipse](eclipse.md) or [IntelliJ](intellij.md).
