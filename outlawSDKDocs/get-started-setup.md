# Get started with Java in Azure

## Set up your environment

[Install the Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) for your platform. You'll use the CLI to create the configuration your applications will need to run in Azure without the need to work through the Azure portal.

Once you have the Azure CLI 2.0 installed, login to Azure (you'll need to approve the access for the CLI for your account) and verify the installation:

```bash
az login
az account list
```
